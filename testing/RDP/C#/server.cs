// We start by creating a TcpListener object on the RDP port (3389) and starting it with the Start() method.
// We then call the AcceptTcpClient() method on the listener, which blocks until a client connects. When a client does connect, we accept the connection and get a TcpClient object to interact with the client.
// We then call the GetStream() method on the TcpClient object to get a NetworkStream object to read and write data to the client.
// We send a buffer of data to the client using the Write() method on the NetworkStream.
// We receive the response from the client using the Read() method on the NetworkStream.
// Finally, we close the connection and stop the listener with the Close() and Stop() methods.
